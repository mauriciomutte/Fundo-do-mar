  <section class="introduction">
    <p class="introduction__txt">When sitting in front of the ocean, have you ever wondered about how deep the ocean is and which mysteries does it hide? <br>
    Our planet's surface is 71% covered by water in the liquid state. 97,4% of that water comes from the oceans, resultingin around 68% of the planet being covered by the oceans' water.
    Over two thirds of our planet is covered by the oceans' water, yet 95% is still left unexplored by us, human beings.</p>

      <p class="curiosity__info">The Challenger Deep is the deepest point of the ocean, more than 10,900 m below sea level. It is so deep that Mount Everest would fit there and it would still lack 2km to appear at sea level.</p>

      <p class="curiosity__info">The Challenger Deep was visited for the first time in 1960 by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh. Since than, only one other person went down there, the cinema director James Cameron. The Challenger Deep was visited by only 3 people, while more than 10 astronauts walked on the Moon.</p>

        <p class="animals__info">Until 2013, giant squids with more than 1m were never observed in their natural habitat, 1000m deep. The giant squid was found in Japan, the animal was captured for analysis by researchers, but returned alive to the sea days later.</p>

        <p class="animals__info">The Anglerfish is one of the fishes that live in the depths of the ocean. He became famous for his appearance in the movie "Finding Nemo".

      <h3 class="obstacles__name">Pression</h3>
      <p class="obstacles__info">Since water is much denser than air, every 10m below sea level, one more atmosphere of pressure is added. At 60m deep, a diver feels like seven atmospheres are squeezing it, enough for the air in the pressurized cylinder to become toxic.</p>

      <p class="obstacles__info">Between 200m and 1000m deep, sunlight completely dissipates into the ocean. For those who dive in this depth, the best flashlight doesn't illuminate more than 25m around them.</p>
